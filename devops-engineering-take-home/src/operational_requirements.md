# Key Operational Considerations

This document outlines the essential operational aspects that your deployment pattern should address.

## üîç Monitoring & Observability

### Basic Monitoring Requirements

Your solution should include:

- **CloudWatch Logs**: Structured logging with appropriate retention
- **Basic Alarms**: Error rate and latency monitoring
- **Health Monitoring**: Ability to check service health
- **Request Tracking**: Correlation IDs for debugging

### Essential Metrics to Consider

- Lambda function errors and duration
- Configuration retrieval failures  
- Invalid request patterns
- Service availability and response times

### Logging Best Practices

The service already implements structured logging. Your infrastructure should:
- Configure appropriate log retention (cost vs. debugging needs)
- Consider log aggregation for multi-environment visibility
- Ensure sensitive data is not logged

## üö® Error Handling & Alerting

### Key Error Scenarios to Monitor

- **Client Errors (4xx)**: Invalid requests, missing fields, validation failures
- **Server Errors (5xx)**: Service unavailable, configuration issues, AWS service problems
- **Configuration Issues**: SSM parameter access failures, invalid settings

### Alerting Approach

Your monitoring should distinguish between:
- **Critical**: Service unavailable, high error rates
- **Warning**: Elevated errors, performance degradation  
- **Info**: Configuration changes, unusual patterns

Consider notification channels (email, Slack, PagerDuty) appropriate for each severity level.

## üîí Security Considerations

### IAM Best Practices

Your Lambda execution role should follow least privilege principles:

- **CloudWatch Logs**: Create log groups and write logs
- **SSM Parameters**: Read configuration parameters (scoped to your service)
- **API Gateway**: Integration permissions if using API Gateway

### Security in CI/CD

Consider including these security practices:
- **Dependency Scanning**: Check for vulnerabilities in Python packages
- **Secret Scanning**: Prevent credentials from being committed
- **Infrastructure Security**: Validate IaC configurations for security issues

### Data Handling

- Ensure proper handling of user data in logs and storage
- Consider encryption requirements for sensitive data
- Plan for appropriate data retention policies

## üöÄ Deployment & Configuration

### Multi-Environment Strategy

Your solution should support:
- **Development**: Rapid iteration, relaxed monitoring
- **Staging**: Production-like testing, comprehensive validation
- **Production**: High availability, security, monitoring

### Configuration Management

The service uses SSM Parameter Store for configuration. Consider:
- Environment-specific parameter paths
- Secure handling of sensitive configuration
- Fallback strategies when parameters are unavailable
- Configuration change tracking and rollback

### Deployment Approaches

Think about appropriate deployment strategies:
- **Simple**: Direct deployment for development
- **Blue-Green**: Zero-downtime deployments
- **Canary**: Gradual rollout with monitoring
- **Rollback**: Quick recovery from issues

## üí° Additional Considerations

### Resource Optimization
- Right-size Lambda memory and timeout settings
- Consider cost vs. performance tradeoffs
- Plan for scaling and concurrency limits

### Operational Excellence
- Include appropriate resource tagging
- Plan for troubleshooting and debugging
- Consider backup and disaster recovery needs
- Document operational procedures

### Future Enhancements
Your pattern should be extensible for:
- Additional AWS services integration
- Enhanced monitoring and alerting
- Multi-region deployments
- Advanced deployment strategies
